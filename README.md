# Royal-Reader-Book-Store
Royal Reader Book Store is a fun project I created for my Case Study in Business Programming Course. The website has 4 different CRUD programs (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) that allow you to manipulate the data on the php/myadmin site.

Royal Reader Book Store: The main component of the site, the royal reader book store section allows you to add books to the catalogue selection and then you can use the search functionality to search through them. Saves the data onto our database. 
Royal Reader Manual Shopping Cart: Manually add books to our shopping cart along with your name, you can update and delete books.
Royal Reader Poll: Creates simply polls for the royal reader site
Royal Reader Book Notepad: saves your favorite books in a reading list so you can remember or create a list of books you want to read and keep track of them by deleting after reading. 
Royal Reader Author Registry: Authors register onto the site to keep track of who publishes books, unauthorized authors can then have their books deleted easily.
